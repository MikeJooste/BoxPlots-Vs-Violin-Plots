# Python_Visualisations
This project displays some of the functionality that the seaborn visualisation packages offer. I've found it useful to utilise this as a framework to pivot off of for new projects.

This forms part of my ongoing efforts to introduce new types of visualisations to our different clients and stakeholders. By educating decision makers on how to intepret Box Plot and their more sophisticated cousins "Violin Plots" we can infer ranges and probablities very effectively. 

In terms of being able to make decisions based on visualisations this class of visualisation often proves more effective than the standard bar and scatter plots decision makers are often exposed to.
